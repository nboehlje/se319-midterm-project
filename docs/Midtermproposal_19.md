## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. About Nathanial Boehlje

Nathanial is a sophomore in Software Engineering. He has professional experience developing web applications using technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS and C# (.NET). 

More recently, his professional focus has shifted to backend infrastructure. This includes the design and development of Web APIs, cloud infrastructure, and IoT messaging systems.   

### 1.2. About Nathan Willimack

Nathan is a junior in Software Engineering, with a passion for frontend and game development. He has experience in building dynamic web applications using JavaScript, React, and CSS, and has worked on various projects involving user interface design and interactive features. Recently, Nathan has been expanding his skills into game development, focusing on building 2D browser-based games using modern frameworks.

## 2. Purpose

Trying to keep you mind stress-free while waiting for something personally significant to occur can be challenging, sometimes the most effective way to reduce stress is by engaging in a healthy distraction.

Simple, browser-based games can be an enjoyable way to spend time while sitting in a waiting room or attempting to clear you nerves before an important presentation. For example, waiting at the doctor's office or taking a small break right before you deliver a stressful update on your project at work. 

## 3. Goals and Objectives

### 3.1. Goals

1. To develop an entertaining browser game that will provide a small (non-addictive) distraction to players. I.e. provide a small dose of joy to ease the mind before a potentially stressful event.

2. The game should be interactive and simple. It should also support player personalization and recognition of achievement.

### 3.2. Objectives

1. Develop an interactive space travel game where the user provides input through their keyboard to direct a spaceship through a field of asteroids.
    1. Users will navigate their ship by pressing the right and left arrow keys.
    2. Users can shoot at the asteroids to destroy them, by pressing the space key.
    3. The game ends when the ship is struck by an asteroid OR 5 minutes has elapsed.

2. Develop personalized player experience.
    1. Allow users to create a custom user profile and upload a photo of themselves on a "profile" page.

3. Develop a leader-board page where users can view their 10 highest scores. (Recognition of player achievement)

4. Develop 4 web pages:
    1. A main/central page with information about the game and links to the 3 other pages.
    2. The game surface page, where the user plays the game. 
    3. A profile page where the user can view and edit their profile information.
    4. A leaderboard page where users can view their top 10 highest scores. 

## 4. Project

### 4.1. Description
The game will be a "space invaders" style shooter where the user directs their ship with the right and left arrow keys, clearing the asteroids from the ship's path.

### 4.2. Wireframes
Home Page:
This page will provide information about the game and links to the other pages (game surface, profile, leaderboard). It will also have a brief introduction about the game and a "Start Game" button.
Example:
```
+--------------------------------------+
|       2D Pixel Shooter               |
+--------------------------------------+
| [Start Game] [Profile] [Leaderboard] |
+--------------------------------------+
|       Welcome to the 2D              |
|     Pixel Shooter Game!              |
|    Navigate your spaceship           |
|   and destroy the asteroids!         |
+--------------------------------------+
```
Game play Page:
The core gameplay area, where users will control their spaceship, shoot asteroids, and track their score and time. The page will also show player health status at the top.
Example:
```
+------------------------------------+
| Player Health: 100 | Time: 00:00   |
+------------------------------------+
|                                    |
|                                    |
|         [Spaceship]                |
|                                    |
|         *Asteroids*                |
|                                    |
+------------------------------------+
```
Profile Page:
This page will allow users to create and update their profiles, including uploading a profile picture. There will be fields for the username and a button to save changes.
Example:
```
+-----------------------------+
|         Profile Page        |
+-----------------------------+
|  [Profile Picture]          |
|  [Upload New Picture]       |
|                             |
|  Username: [______]         |
|                             |
|  [Save Changes]             |
+-----------------------------+
```
Leaderboard Page:
The leaderboard page will display the top 10 highest scores, showing the player's username and their score.
Example:
```
+-----------------------------+
|        Leaderboard          |
+-----------------------------+
|  1. Username1 - Score1      |
|  2. Username2 - Score2      |
|  3. Username3 - Score3      |
|  ...                        |
|  10. Username10 - Score10   |
+-----------------------------+
```
